    <h3><b>Requests</b></h3>
    <b>email</b>: scarletmusic at posteo dot de
    <br><br>
    Feel free to reach out any time — I will get back to you as soon as possible.<br>
    Let me know about your project, your artistic vision for the material, deadlines and how much creative freedom I am granted with respect to editing the recordings.
    <br><br>
    Please use a file-transfer service of your choice and provide me with the link to all the tracks well in advance of the mixing session.<br>
    Doing so will give me a chance to go over the material <b>beforehand</b> and let you know, if any problems occurred during the transfer/recording.<br>
    This way I have enough time to get back to you/the recording engineer.
    <br><br>
    Note that the <b>entire balance must be paid in advance.</b> No files will be released to the artist or label until the balance is fully paid.
    <br><br>

    <h3><b>Planning a Mixing Session</b></h3>
    Please provide the recorded material as follows:
    <br>
    <b>bit depth</b>: 24bit | <b>sample rate</b>: 44.1kHz/48kHz | <b>file format</b>: .WAV
    <br><br>
    All tracks should be exported from the same sync point — I can't use pro tools/cubase/logic/garageband sessions, only raw audio tracks.
    <br><br>
    Please disable any plugins and automation and check all tracks for audible edits;<br>
    having everything cut and aligned before starting to actually mix your project, will save a tremendous amount of time.
    <br><br>
    Make sure that mono/stereo tracks are exported as such.
    <br><br>
    Avoid clipping.
    <br><br>
    If each song/piece is recorded in a separate session, please make one folder of raw audio stems per song.<br>
    The folder should be labeled as the song title, but the audio files within, should not carry the song name.<br>
    tracks should be labeled as: "kick," "oh L," "bass 414," "gtr sm57", ...<br><br>
    <br>
    If all songs were recording in one session (i.e. with all songs sharing the same kick, snare, etc) that is totally fine as well:<br>
    Just send one track per mic for the whole album.

    <h4>Drums</h4>
    Please mic top and bottom of the snare.
    <br><br>
    If you are spot micing (close micing) the drums:
    <br><br>
    If possible please include some kind of room mic/s in addition to the close mics. 
    <br>
    If there's a way to place the room mic/s outside the tracking room with the door open, or facing away from the kit towards the wall, that would be great.
    <br>
    The goal is to have as much diffuse sound and as little direct sound as possible in the room mics.

    <h4>Guitar/Bass</h4>
    If you record using DI-tracks and emulation software, please provide me with both, your dialed in tone and the raw audio.
    <br>
    Letting the pickups face away from any electronic device such as monitors/speaker can help reduce the noise floor during recording.<br>
    This becomes more important, if you play long sustained chords/notes that ring out.

    <h4>Vocals</h4>
    Please use a pop screen and mic stand when recording.
    <br><br>

    <h3><b>Planning a Mastering Session</b></h3>
    Please provide me with the final mixes at the same bit depth and sample rate at which they were recorded (usually 24 bit and 44.1 - 96 khz).
    <br><br>
    Do not heavily compress or peak-limit you final mixes, leaving plenty of headroom will allow me to provide you with a better-sounding final master.
